![1 KfZYFUT2OKfjekJlCeYvuQ](https://github.com/AWESOME04/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/assets/102630199/8fd1227d-075b-406d-a714-6dbe0bc6afb3)

## Description
This project aims to calculate the Big O complexity of each line of code in a given algorithm or program, as well as the overall Big O complexity. The purpose is to analyze the efficiency and performance characteristics of the code in terms of time complexity.

## Usage
To use this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```
3. Open the code file(s) that you want to analyze.
4. Identify each line of code and determine its corresponding Big O complexity.
5. Calculate the overall Big O complexity of the code based on the identified complexities of individual lines.
6. Document the findings in a report or README file.

## Big O Complexity Analysis
For each line of code, analyze its complexity based on the following guidelines:

- **O(1)**: Constant time complexity.
- **O(log n)**: Logarithmic time complexity.
- **O(n)**: Linear time complexity.
- **O(n log n)**: Linearithmic time complexity.
- **O(n^2)**: Quadratic time complexity.
- **O(2^n)**: Exponential time complexity.

Assign the corresponding complexity to each line and make note of any loops, nested loops, recursive calls, or other factors that affect the overall complexity.

After analyzing each line, calculate the overall Big O complexity of the code by considering the most dominant term. If multiple sections of the code have different complexities, add them together to determine the overall complexity.

Document the analysis and results in the report or README file, including a summary of the complexities for each line and the final overall Big O complexity.

## Example
As an example, you can refer to the provided code file in this repository, analyze each line's complexity, and calculate the overall Big O complexity. The example code and analysis can serve as a reference for conducting your own Big O complexity analysis.
