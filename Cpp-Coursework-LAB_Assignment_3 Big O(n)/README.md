LAB 2

1.Write a C++ program to implement the Number Guessing Game. In this game the
computer chooses a random number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to
guess the number in as few attempts as possible. Each time the player enters a
guess, the computer tells him whether the guess is too high, too low, or right. Once
the player guesses the number, the game is over.

2. Write a program that lets the user perform arithmetic operations on two numbers.
Your program must be menu driven, allowing the user to select the operation (+, -,
*, or /) and input the numbers. Furthermore, your program must consist of
following functions:
a. Function showChoice: This function shows the options to the user and
explains how to enter data.

b. Function add: This function accepts two number as arguments and returns sum.

c. Function subtract: This function accepts two number as arguments and returns
their difference.

d. Function multiply: This function accepts two number as arguments and returns
product.

e. Function divide: This function accepts two number as arguments and returns
quotient.

3. Raising a number to a power p is the same as multiplying n by itself p times. Write
a function called power that takes two arguments, a double value for n and an int2

value for p, and return the result as double value. Use default argument of 2 for p,
so that if this argument is omitted the number will be squared. Write the main
function that gets value from the user to test power function.

4. Using your knowledge from patterns, conditional statements and nested for loops
write a function to display the output below. Your program must include at least
two loops, one nested within another, in order to receive credit. In addition, you
are only allowed to use, at most, two cout statements.
