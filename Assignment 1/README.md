This project is aimed at showcasing an algorithm for determining the median of an array and discussing the differences between a Circular Array and a Linked List.

## Median of an Array

![4-min-1-1](https://github.com/AWESOME04/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/assets/102630199/7236e242-10b0-4b90-83bd-1d947cbba9be)

The algorithm implemented in this project can efficiently find the median of an array. The median is defined as the middle element of a sorted array. The program takes an array as input and returns the median value. It handles both odd and even-length arrays to provide an accurate result.

## Circular Array vs. Linked List

This project also provides a discussion on the differences between a Circular Array and a Linked List. It highlights key characteristics, such as data structure, insertion and deletion operations, memory management, and access efficiency. Understanding these differences can help in choosing the appropriate data structure for specific scenarios.

## Usage

To use the program and explore the differences between Circular Arrays and Linked Lists, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd my-project
   ```

3. Run the program:
   ```
   find_median.cpp
   ```

Feel free to modify the array values in the program to find the median of different arrays. Additionally, examine the code and comments to understand the implementation details and the differences between Circular Arrays and Linked Lists.
